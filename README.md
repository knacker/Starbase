Starbase is a website that will be used to provide a simple overview about stars, as well as interesting facts or objects, that were discovered in the observable universe. 
The User will see an interactive website, where he can click through each entry, as well as simple information regarding each of them. The main purpose is to show the maybe (not yet) interested person, how interesting the cosmos and its objects actually are and in what relation they stand to each other.

### What are stars?

Stars are massive self-luminous celestial bodies of gas, that shine by radiation delivered from its internal energy sources. Of all the stars in the universe, only a small percentage of them is visible to the human eye. Many of them occur in pairs, multiple systems or star clusters. Given the huge amount of them, one would assume that there are many different kinds of stars. And there are! In the following paragraph you will learn about how stars can be different from each other and how these differences come together.(Source: https://www.space.com/35069-what-is-an-earthlike-planet.html)

### What kinds of stars do exist?
Well, that answer is kind of complicated. Since there are so many, it won’t be possible for us to list all of them here. The harvard classification system is being used to classify stars by surface temperature from about 2.000 to 40.000 Kelvin. In the following table you can see what kinds of stars exist and what temperature they have. Also, there is a picture, if you are interested!


###### Here you will have to put the data from /doc/stars/Star_classes.png into a XML File and show the data in a table!

Now that we have seen the most common stars, there are a few other obscure stars, which can be found here(hyperlink to Neutronstar.html).

## title: Neutron Stars

### The Birth of the star

When massive stars run out of fuel, their gravitation causes their collapse. This process is called a supernova. When that happens, the gravity compresses the core of the star so hard that even the stars atoms are obliterated. After all that has happened, we have a newborn neutron star. A giant atomic nucleus with the mass of 500.000 times of the earth. They have an extremely high density and can rotate a hundred times per second!(source: https://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/research/fundamental/neutronstars)

## Pulsars

Most of the neutron stars can be observed as pulsars. Pulsars are rotating neutron stars, which have pulses of radiation at regular intervals. The strong magnetic fields along the poles of the pulsar funnel jets of particles, which produce powerful beams of light.

## Magnetars

Magnetars are another type of neutron star. In a regular neutron star, the magnetic files are trillions of times the earths, but in the case of magnetars, it's another 1000 times stronger. Like all neutron stars, the crust of the star is locked in the magnetic field. A small movement of the crust can mean that huge amounts of energy can be released in the form of electromagnetic radiation. A magnetar called SGR 1806-20 had a burst, where in 1/10 of a second it released more energy than the sun has in 100.000 years combined.

# Planets.html

## title: Planets : An Overview

### Overview

Currently, there are more planets than stars in the milky way. The ones that are orbiting our star, the sun(sol), are counted to be eight. We have rocky planets, such as Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, while there are also Gas giants such as Jupiter, saturn and ice giants, such as uranus and neptune. A even smaller planet, called dwarf planet, is the planet pluto.(source:https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/overview/)

### What are planets?

Now, this is a hard question. While we know that Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets, there are also Pluto and Ceres, which until a certain point in time, were still called planets. In 2006, there came up a definition, what a planet must have, to be called a planet. According to it, a planet must do three things:
1. It has to orbit a star.
2. It must be big enough to have enough gravity to force it into a spherical shape.
3. It must be big enough that its gravity cleared away any other objects of a similar size near its orbit around the sun.

### Interesting planets
Now, that we know how a planet is defined, we will show you the most interesting(to us) kinds of planets. There are Earth-like planets, which you can read about more here(hyperlink to planets.html). Then there are also so-called Exoplanets, which you can read about more here(hyperlink to exoplanets.html).


# Exoplanets.html
## title: Exoplanets
### What are they?
Exoplanets are all planets that orbit another star, which is not the sun. There are free floating planets that once orbited a star, but have been ejected from the system they are from.

### Known Exoplanets
While we know that there are a lot of Exoplanets, we will only list a few here, which seem to be the most interesting ones and pictures of what they might look like.


1. Kepler-186f        -first rocky planet to be found in a habitable zone, which means that the temperature ist right for liquid water

2. Kepler-16b        -first planet discovered that orbits two stars

3. Kepler-22b        -planet in habitable zone and possible water-world planet

# Earthlikes.html

## title:Earthlike planets

### What makes a Planet earth like?

A planet considered earth-like is rocky on its surface and about 0.5 to 1.5 times the size of the earth. They also sit in the habitable zone of their orbiting stars, which means they have the potential to support liquid water on their surface. The ability to have water means that the planet may be inhabited by life.
Known earth like planets
It is known that these planets exist, but havent been seen yet. We do have a few potentially habitable planets though. One example for that might be Proxima Centauri b, which might be possibly habitable, but is very unlikely to be. The best chance at success is targeting our closest neighbor system, Alpha Centauri. With Alpha Centauri being a binary system, there is a 85% chance that there will be a potentially habitable planet. With Alpha Centauri being 4,34 light years away, it still is currently impossible to get there in a human life time, taking 100 years. We still have a long way to go.
