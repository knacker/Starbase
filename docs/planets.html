    <h1>Planets: An overview</h1>
    <h2>What are planets?</h2>
    <p>
        Now, this is a hard question. While we know that Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets, there are also Pluto and
        Ceres, which until a certain point in time, were still called planets. In 2006, there came up a definition, what
        a planet must have, to be called a planet. According to it, a planet must do three things:
        1. It has to orbit a star.
        2. It must be big enough to have enough gravity to force it into a spherical shape.
        3. It must be big enough that its gravity cleared away any other objects of a similar size near its orbit around
        the sun.

    <h2>Interesting planets</h2>

        Now, that we know how a planet is defined, we will show you the most interesting(to us) kinds of planets. There
        are Earth-like planets, which you can read about more <a href="planets.html">here</a>. Then there are also
        so-called Exoplanets, which you can read about more <a href="exoplanets.html">here</a>.
