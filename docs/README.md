## title: Welcome to starbase.info!

Did you know that we are know more about the endless void of the universe, than about the dark depths of our oceans?   Outside our atmosphere there are many secrets, a huge number of known, but also unknown objects just waiting to be discovered. Many of our findings are based on discoveries that were already made and there are more and more to come!  On this website we would like to give you a small impression of what is already known in the universe. Interactively you will dive into the different topics and learn more about stars, galaxies or black holes.

# galaxies.html

## title: Galaxies

A galaxy is a large collection of stars, planetary systems, gas nebulae, dust clouds, dark matter and other astronomical objects bound by gravity. Its diameter can be several hundred thousand light years and its appearance, greeting and composition can vary greatly.
With current technology, more than 50 billion galaxies can be observed from Earth. Since 2016, research assumes that there are about a billion.

### Structure of a Galaxy

Large galaxies often form the structure of spirals. Such galaxies are disk-shaped, whose appearance resembles a spiral pattern with several spiral arms. The central region, called "bulge", turns on its own axis and consists mainly of older stars. Spiral galaxies contain a relatively large amount of gas in the disk, so new stars can be formed permanently.

### Types of Galaxies

Besides the spiral galaxies there are other types. Among them are for example active galaxies or dwarf galaxies. 
Dwarf galaxies are galaxies with lower brightness and much more numerous than giant galaxies. The number of stars in a dwarf galaxy is only between a few 100,000 and a few billion stars, while our spiral Milky Way counts about 300 billion stars.
An active galaxy is generally a subgroup of galaxies with a particularly bright core. This high luminosity most likely indicates an active massive black hole at the center of the galaxy.

# galaxy-cluster.html

## title: Clusters of Galaxies 

Clusters of galaxies contain up to several thousand galaxies moving at different velocities in the common gravitational field (force field due to gravity and certain inertial effects). According to the current state of research, they are the largest structures in the universe that are gravitationally bound.
The main part of the mass of the galaxy clusters is dark matter (about 85%). They are also penetrated by a thin gas, 10 to 100 million Kelvin hot, which can be observed through its X-rays. This gas makes up about 13% of the mass of a galaxy cluster. The remaining 2% of the visible mass is present in the stars and planets of the galaxies. In the middle of galaxy clusters there is often a huge elliptical galaxy.

# black-holes.html

## title: Black Holes

A black hole, an object that swallows up everything and there is no escape. Neither light, matter, objects nor information can escape the immense gravity. This is how many people imagine a black hole, but is this correct?

A black hole is a place where gravity pulls everything in it. Because a black hole does not allow light to escape, they are not visible to the human eye. Special tools help to define the position of black holes. They are formed as result of a dying sun. Shortly before the death of a star its mass collapses and is concentrated to an enormous density. The core is called a „singularity“ which is surrounded by a sphere called „event horizon“. The event horizon is the point which crossing causes a „one way ticket“. Something that gets into the radius of a black hole, will not return out of it. That fact that a way out is unimaginable, is described by the general theory of relativity by an extreme curvature of spacetime.

###### Embed: /doc/black-holes/structure_black_hole.jpg

### Types of Black Holes

Stellar-mass black holes are formed when a massive star collapses. They can be found scattered throughout the galaxy, in the same places where stars exist.

Supermassive black holes are found at the center of nearly every large galaxy. The exact origin of supermassive black holes is still unknown. It is assumed that there must be a connection between the formation of the black hole and the galaxy, since there are correlated in the size of each other.

# stars.html

## title: Stars

### What are stars?

Stars are massive self-luminous celestial bodies of gas, that shine by radiation delivered from its internal energy sources. Of all the stars in the universe, only a small percentage of them is visible to the human eye. Many of them occur in pairs, multiple systems or star clusters. Given the huge amount of them, one would assume that there are many different kinds of stars. And there are! In the following paragraph you will learn about how stars can be different from each other and how these differences come together.(Source: https://www.space.com/35069-what-is-an-earthlike-planet.html)

### What kinds of stars do exist?
Well, that answer is kind of complicated. Since there are so many, it won’t be possible for us to list all of them here. The harvard classification system is being used to classify stars by surface temperature from about 2.000 to 40.000 Kelvin. In the following table you can see what kinds of stars exist and what temperature they have. Also, there is a picture, if you are interested!


###### Here you will have to put the data from /doc/stars/Star_classes.png into a XML File and show the data in a table!

Now that we have seen the most common stars, there are a few other obscure stars, which can be found here(hyperlink to Neutronstar.html).

`TODO (Christopher): Create the stars.html, add the table with content and embed the image. `

# neutronstar.html

## title: Neutron Stars

### The Birth of the star

When massive stars run out of fuel, their gravitation causes their collapse. This process is called a supernova. When that happens, the gravity compresses the core of the star so hard that even the stars atoms are obliterated. After all that has happened, we have a newborn neutron star. A giant atomic nucleus with the mass of 500.000 times of the earth. They have an extremely high density and can rotate a hundred times per second!(source: https://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/research/fundamental/neutronstars)

## Pulsars

Most of the neutron stars can be observed as pulsars. Pulsars are rotating neutron stars, which have pulses of radiation at regular intervals. The strong magnetic fields along the poles of the pulsar funnel jets of particles, which produce powerful beams of light.

## Magnetars

Magnetars are another type of neutron star. In a regular neutron star, the magnetic files are trillions of times the earths, but in the case of magnetars, it's another 1000 times stronger. Like all neutron stars, the crust of the star is locked in the magnetic field. A small movement of the crust can mean that huge amounts of energy can be released in the form of electromagnetic radiation. A magnetar called SGR 1806-20 had a burst, where in 1/10 of a second it released more energy than the sun has in 100.000 years combined.

# planets.html

## title: Planets : An Overview

### Overview

Currently, there are more planets than stars in the milky way. The ones that are orbiting our star, the sun(sol), are counted to be eight. We have rocky planets, such as Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, while there are also Gas giants such as Jupiter, saturn and ice giants, such as uranus and neptune. A even smaller planet, called dwarf planet, is the planet pluto.(source:https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/overview/)
###### Embed Picture: Planets2013.svg

### What are planets?

Now, this is a hard question. While we know that Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets, there are also Pluto and Ceres, which until a certain point in time, were still called planets. In 2006, there came up a definition, what a planet must have, to be called a planet. According to it, a planet must do three things:
1. It has to orbit a star.
2. It must be big enough to have enough gravity to force it into a spherical shape.
3. It must be big enough that its gravity cleared away any other objects of a similar size near its orbit around the sun.
(source: https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/in-depth/)

### Interesting planets
Now, that we know how a planet is defined, we will show you the most interesting(to us) kinds of planets. There are Earth-like planets, which you can read about more here(hyperlink to planets.html). Then there are also so-called Exoplanets, which you can read about more here(hyperlink to exoplanets.html).

# Exoplanets.html
## title: Exoplanets
### What are they?
Exoplanets are all planets that orbit another star, which is not the sun. There are free floating planets that once orbited a star, but have been ejected from the system they are from. 
#### (source:http://exoplanets.org/methodology.html)
### Known Exoplanets
While we know that there are a lot of Exoplanets, we will only list a few here, which seem to be the most interesting ones and pictures of what they might look like.

# earthlikes.html

## title: Earthlike planets

### What makes a Planet earth like?

A planet considered earth-like is rocky on its surface and about 0.5 to 1.5 times the size of the earth. They also sit in the habitable zone of their orbiting stars, which means they have the potential to support liquid water on their surface. The ability to have water means that the planet may be inhabited by life.
Known earth like planets
It is known that these planets exist, but havent been seen yet. We do have a few potentially habitable planets though. One example for that might be Proxima Centauri b, which might be possibly habitable, but is very unlikely to be. The best chance at success is targeting our closest neighbor system, Alpha Centauri. With Alpha Centauri being a binary system, there is a 85% chance that there will be a potentially habitable planet. With Alpha Centauri being 4,34 light years away, it still is currently impossible to get there in a human life time, taking 100 years. We still have a long way to go.

## Look and Feel

Here we will give you a description how the website should be structured. <br/>
The background should be a dark blue background with a gradient into purple. The brightness of the background should be adjusted so that the contrast to the content is clearly visible. The Content Wrapper should be dark grey, so that the white font of headlines and text is well readable. The font is „Arial“ and the font color white. Please make sure, that the website is responsive for every screen resolution and size. 

`TODO (Christopher): Edit the style, look and feel. `

### Header

The header should include all topics of the website (Home, Galaxies, Blackholes, Stars, Planets). The Home button should be placed in the middle of the header (SVG Logo). The  should scale up a little bit, in case the user hovers over it. Topics with more subtopics has to be a drop down menu to get an overview of all subpages (Galaxies, Stars, Planets). The banner is a black rounded box with an opacity of 15%. The buttons are transparent with a thin purple border. By hovering over them, the buttons should light up in a white color and the text changes to a black font color. The header is very important for navigation through the website. Therefore the user could have the   opportunity to reach the header from any point of the page. That means a header attached to the top, even when the user is scrolling down, would be great feature. 

`TODO (Toni): Edit the header. `

### Body

The Content Wrapper includes all content like text and pictures. He has a fixed size in the middle of a page (not overall browser size). Headlines have to be centered, paragraphs alignment left. It would be great, when the user has the opportunity to get back to the top of the page, by simply clicking on a button in the lower right corner. 

`TODO (Toni): Edit the body. `

### Footer

The consists of a hyperlink to the privacy page and a copyright lettering on the left. The footer is in the same color as the conent wrapper.

/doc/web-structure/strucuture_example_starbase.png shows an example of how the website should look like
