    <h1>Galaxies</h1>
    <p>
        A galaxy is a large collection of stars, planetary systems, gas nebulae, dust clouds, dark matter and other
        astronomical objects bound by gravity. Its diameter can be several hundred thousand light years and its
        appearance, greeting and composition can vary greatly.
        With current technology, more than 50 billion galaxies can be observed from Earth. Since 2016, research assumes
        that there are about a billion.

    <h2>Structure of a Galaxy</h2>
    <p>
        Large galaxies often form the structure of spirals. Such galaxies are disk-shaped, whose appearance resembles a
        spiral pattern with several spiral arms. The central region, called "bulge", turns on its own axis and consists
        mainly of older stars. Spiral galaxies contain a relatively large amount of gas in the disk, so new stars can be
        formed permanently.

    <h2>Types of Galaxies</h2>
    <p>
        Besides the spiral galaxies there are other types. Among them are for example active galaxies or dwarf galaxies.
        Dwarf galaxies are galaxies with lower brightness and much more numerous than giant galaxies. The number of
        stars in a dwarf galaxy is only between a few 100,000 and a few billion stars, while our spiral Milky Way counts
        about 300 billion stars.
        An active galaxy is generally a subgroup of galaxies with a particularly bright core. This high luminosity most
        likely indicates an active massive black hole at the center of the galaxy.
