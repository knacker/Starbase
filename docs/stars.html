    <h2>What are stars?</h2>
    <p>
        Stars are massive self-luminous celestial bodies of gas, that shine by radiation delivered from its internal
        energy sources. Of all the stars in the universe, only a small percentage of them is visible to the human eye.
        Many of them occur in pairs, multiple systems or star clusters. Given the huge amount of them, one would assume
        that there are many different kinds of stars. And there are! In the following paragraph you will learn about how
        stars can be different from each other and how these differences come together.(Source:

    <h2>What kinds of stars do exist?</h2>
    <p>
        Well, that answer is kind of complicated. Since there are so many, it wonâ€™t be possible for us to list all of
        them here. The harvard classification system is being used to classify stars by surface temperature from about
        2.000 to 40.000 Kelvin. In the following table you can see what kinds of stars exist and what temperature they
        have. Also, there is a picture, if you are interested!
