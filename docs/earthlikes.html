    <h2>What makes a planet earthlike?</h2>
    <p>
        A planet considered earth-like is rocky on its surface and about 0.5 to 1.5 times the size of the earth. They
        also sit in the habitable zone of their orbiting stars, which means they have the potential to support liquid
        water on their surface. The ability to have water means that the planet may be inhabited by life.
        Known earth like planets
        It is known that these planets exist, but havent been seen yet. We do have a few potentially habitable planets
        though. One example for that might be Proxima Centauri b, which might be possibly habitable, but is very
        unlikely to be. The best chance at success is targeting our closest neighbor system, Alpha Centauri. With Alpha
        Centauri being a binary system, there is a 85% chance that there will be a potentially habitable planet. With
        Alpha Centauri being 4,34 light years away, it still is currently impossible to get there in a human life time,
        taking 100 years. We still have a long way to go.
